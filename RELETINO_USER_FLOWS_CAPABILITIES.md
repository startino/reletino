# Reletino Platform - User Flows and Capabilities Outline

## Overview
Reletino is a platform designed to deliver a modern, integrated user experience through a robust web interface and a powerful API backend. This document outlines key user flows and capabilities of the platform.

## Architecture Overview
- **Web Front-end (web/src):**
  - Developed using a modern framework (e.g., SvelteKit) with server-side rendering and client-side routing.
  - Key components:
    - `app.html`: The main HTML template.
    - `hooks.server.ts`: Server hooks for global operations and middleware functionalities.
    - `routes/`: Contains route definitions for different pages and components.
    - `app.css`: Styles and layout for the user interface.

- **API Backend (services/api):**
  - A Python-based service managing backend logic and data interactions.
  - Key components:
    - `pyproject.toml` & `poetry.lock`: Dependency and project configuration.
    - `src/`: Contains source code for API endpoints and business logic.
    - Additional configuration files are used for deployment and environment settings.

## Key User Flows

### 1. User Onboarding and Authentication
- **Flow:**
  1. The user accesses the landing page (served by `app.html`).
  2. Navigation to sign-up or login forms occurs via dedicated routes.
  3. The front-end communicates with API endpoints to handle user authentication.
  4. Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to a personalized dashboard.
- **Capabilities:**
  - Secure signup and login mechanisms.
  - Session management and token-based authentication.

### 2. Navigating the Platform
- **Flow:**
  1. Authenticated users interact with a structured navigation menu provided by the SvelteKit routes.
  2. Client-side interactions trigger asynchronous API calls to retrieve or update data.
  3. The application gracefully handles routing and error scenarios.
- **Capabilities:**
  - Dynamic client-side routing and SSR for improved performance.
  - Responsive design that adapts to various devices.
  - Robust error handling and user feedback.

### 3. Data Interaction and CRUD Operations
- **Flow:**
  1. Users view, create, update, or delete resources via the web interface.
  2. Actions performed in the UI result in RESTful API calls to the backend.
  3. The system updates the UI based on responses from the API, ensuring data consistency.
- **Capabilities:**
  - Full CRUD operations for resource management.
  - Validation and business logic processing on the API side.
  - Support for real-time data updates (where applicable).

### 4. Profile and Settings Management
- **Flow:**
  1. Users access their profile and account settings through clearly defined routes.
  2. They can update personal information, manage preferences, and change passwords.
  3. Updates are processed through secure API calls, with both client-side and server-side validations.
- **Capabilities:**
  - Personalized user profiles and settings management.
  - Secure update and validation processes.

## Additional Capabilities and Future Enhancements
- **Scalability:** Modular architecture in both the web and API components allows for easy feature extension.
- **Performance Optimization:** Efficient data fetching and server-side rendering enhance overall user experience.
- **Integration:** The platform is designed to integrate with third-party services (e.g., analytics, notifications) to augment functionality.
- **Security:** Emphasis on secure authentication, data validation, and error handling throughout the platform.
- **Responsive UI/UX:** Modern design principles ensure ease of use across devices and screen sizes.

## Conclusion
Reletino provides a well-integrated system combining a modern web interface with a robust API-driven backend. The outlined user flows and capabilities ensure an intuitive, secure, and scalable experience for end-users, with a clear path for future enhancements and feature extensions.
